* You can create annotations in your pages or posts.
* Once read, you can delete or edit them as well as creating new ones.
* Use cases could be personal annotations or instructions for your review team.
* Works perfect with TinyMCE Advanced.

There are three options:
= Create/edit annotation =
Just select the text and the annotation color. For editing, just select the annotation and click in the same icon.
= Delete annotation =
You can delete the current selected annotation.
= Show/Hide annotation =
You can show or hide current annotations (it doesn't remove the annotations, just hide them).

Annotations are only shown in the TinyMCE editor, that means you will only see them in the admin area.
